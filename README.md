# 🛡️ Phishing URL Scanner (Frontend-Only Project)

A fully frontend-based **Phishing Link Checker** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to simulate how real-world phishing detection works — but **without needing a backend or real API**.


## 🌐 Purpose of This Project

This is a **practice project** to:
- Simulate checking if a URL is safe, suspicious, or malicious.
- Show visual feedback (✅ Safe, ⚠️ Suspicious, 🚨 Dangerous).
- Understand frontend limitations like **CORS**.
- Provide a great base for building an actual phishing detection tool.

## 🧪 Sample URLs You Can Test

| Test Input URL                      | Verdict        |
|------------------------------------|----------------|
| `https://phishingsite.com`         | 🚨 Malicious   |
| `https://unknown-domain.net`       | ⚠️ Suspicious  |
| `https://www.google.com`           | ✅ Safe        |
| `https://badactor.malware.biz`     | 🚨 Malicious   |
| `https://myshop.suspicious.store`  | ⚠️ Suspicious  |


## ❗ Why We Didn't Use a Real API

### 😡 The CORS Problem

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a browser security policy that prevents JavaScript running in a web browser from calling external APIs **unless the server explicitly allows it**.

For example:

```js
fetch("https://ipqualityscore.com/api/json/url/KEY/encodedURL")
Will result in a CORS error like:
Access to fetch at 'https://...' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy

There is **no public phishing detection API** (such as IPQualityScore, Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, etc.) that can be used **directly from a browser** due to these limitations:

- 🚫 **Blocked by CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- 🔐 **Requires a secret API key**, which must never be exposed in frontend code
- 🛑 **Rate-limited** or paid plans
- ⚠️ **Security-sensitive** – exposing such APIs directly is a misuse risk

 This restriction is intentional to protect API misuse and abuse by attackers.


## ✅ Why We Used a Simulated API Instead

To **bypass CORS restrictions** and still demonstrate how a phishing scanner works, we used a **fake API simulation function** like this:

``js
async function fetchDomainReport(domain) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 800));

  if (domain.includes("phish") || domain.includes("malware") || domain.includes("bad")) {
    return { results: [{ verdict: "malicious" }] };
  } else if (domain.includes("unknown") || domain.includes("suspicious")) {
    return { results: [{ verdict: "suspicious" }] };
  } else {
    return { results: [] }; // Safe
  }
}use risk.


## 🧠 How It Works
User inputs a URL in the text field.

isValidURL() validates the format.

getDomain() extracts the domain from the full URL.

fetchDomainReport(domain) simulates a domain scan and returns a verdict.

showResult() displays the result using visual styling (color + message).

## 🧱 Next Steps (For Real Projects)
To build a production-ready phishing scanner:

🛠️ Use a Node.js proxy server to call phishing APIs securely.

🔐 Store API keys on the server-side only.

📊 Log scan results to a database.

👥 Add authentication and history tracking.
